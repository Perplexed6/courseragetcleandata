Coursera Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare a tidy dataset that can be used for later analysis. 

Data for the project is available at:

Intended outcomes are:

1. To create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
 1a.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 1b.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 1c.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 1d.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

2. To create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

In this assignment I have partially achieved (1) only. It has taken me a lot of time to understand this assignment. Given more time and certainly more expertise I could hopefully have achieved both outcomes.However I have learnt a lot from this assignment and I am submitting my work achieved so far.
